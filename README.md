# SAGE: Smart AI-powered Garbage Evaluation

![SAGE Banner](https://your-image-link-here.com)

## 📌 Overview
SAGE is an AI-powered e-waste management system that enhances waste classification and recycling through **machine learning, computer vision, and automation**. It efficiently identifies, sorts, and processes electronic waste to **optimize material recovery**, reduce environmental impact, and lower operational costs. 

With **90%+ accuracy** and **5x faster processing speed**, SAGE is designed to transform the **$144 billion e-waste industry** by ensuring sustainable and profitable waste management.

## 🔬 AI Model Training
1. **Collect E-Waste Images** from sources like OpenImages, Kaggle, or create a dataset.
2. **Preprocess Data** (Resizing, Augmentation, Normalization).
3. **Train AI Model** using TensorFlow/Keras on GPU.
4. **Evaluate & Optimize** for accuracy.

```python
# Example: Load Dataset & Train Model
import tensorflow as tf
model = tf.keras.Sequential([...])
model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='categorical_crossentropy', metrics=['accuracy'])
model.fit(train_data, epochs=10)
```
